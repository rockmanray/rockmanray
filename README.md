I am the bone of my sources. <br>
Logic is my body, and data is my blood. <br>
I have debugged over a thousand lines. <br>
Unknown to crash, nor known to glitch. <br>
Have withstood frustration to build many systems. <br>
Yet, those hands will never cease typing. <br>
So as I compile, "Unlimited Code Works". <br>
